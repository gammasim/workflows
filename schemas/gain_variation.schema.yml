  Fractional gain variation between different photo detectors after
  adjusting the voltage to have approximately the same gain in all channels.
description: |-
  Fractional gain variation between different photo detectors after
  adjusting the voltage to have approximately the same gain in all channels.
  The parameter sets the Gaussian r.m.s. spread of random fluctuations, used
  as \texttt{amplitude *= RandGaus(1., gain_variation)}.
