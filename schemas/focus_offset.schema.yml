description: |-
  Distance of the starlight focus from the camera pixels (light guides)
  entry. In telescopes without dynamic focusing capability (either
  through mirror alignment and camera positioning) this is best set
  such that starlight gets focused onto the camera lid while showers
  are focused onto the pixel entry.
  Zenith angle dependence of the focus offset can be applied and includes
  the constant value $\Delta_0$ and terms depending on cosine and sine
  of the zenith angle. The total focus offset is
  $\Delta = \Delta_0 + \Delta_c + \Delta_s$.
  Set to zero for all 2M telescope types, as it is already included in
  the first of the par:focal-surface-parameters values, assuming the
  design value of that is for a light source at a typical shower maximum
  distance.
