description: |-
  An optional sky map (Az/Alt) of NSB enhancement factors, counted on top
  of the configured pixel NSB p.e. rates and other scaling factors
  mentioned in this section, but not any starlight which might get
  added additionally. Recommend is to provide a regular grid in
  azimuth and altitude. This map will be evaluated for each pixel
  center pointed back into the sky, using the effective focal length
  (no explicit ray-tracing), thus is only suitable for changes in
  sky brightness exceeding the pixel sizes.
