developer_note: |-
  Defined in a sim_telarray configuration file
  (keywords PRIMARY_SEGMENTATION and SECONDARY_SEGMENTATION)
  TODO - discuss usage of anyOf / allOf in this context.
description: |-
  Definition of segments or segment groups of the primary or secondary
  reflector.
  If not active (value "none") then the secondary is assumed
  to be of one circular piece, with an optional central hole. The inner
  and outer diameters still apply, even in case of segmentation.

  Definition of segments or segment groups of the primary or secondary
  reflector.
