short_description: Errors (r.m.s.) in transit time, not related to high voltage.
description: |-
  Errors (r.m.s.) in transit time, additionally to and not related to
  those depending on applied high voltage.
  If this parameter is set to $-1$, the readout interval is assumed to be
  adjusted, pixel by pixel, such that resulting transit time differences
  are within one readout time slice. For correcting transit times by
  electronic means with time steps independent of the sampling frequency the
  par:transit-time-compensate-step and par:transit-time-compensate-error
  can be used.  The resulting transit time difference, after application of
  compensation if used, is reported in the calibration data block, but only
  up to a random accuracy defined by par:transit-time-calib-error.
