description: |-
  With a value of 1, any negative shaped signals are clipped at zero
  (which a non-zero dsum_ignore_below does anyway).
  With a value of $-1$, negative signals are not clipped immediately
  but together with patch-wise pre-summation they are clipped at zero
  after pre-summation.
  A value of zero means that negative shaped signals are preserved
  for the final digital sum.
