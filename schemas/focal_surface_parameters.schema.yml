description: |-
  Defines the position of the focal surface along the optical axis and
  its off-axis shape.  The par:focus-offset still applies, but with a
  curved focal surface only in the camera centre, such that star light
  would be focused on the camera lid surface but light from the typical
  distance of the shower maximum would be focused on the pixel entrance.
  Note that this offset may be impractically small with secondary mirrors
  reducing the plate scale.  The direction of the incoming rays is not
  transformed into the normal plane of the focal surface, thus
  corresponding to pixels shifted w.r.t.\ to a plane.
