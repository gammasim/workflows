description: |-
  Report sample with the largest signal in the range otherwise
  used for ADC sums instead of sampling the pulses and optionally
  integrating signals over a given number of samples.
  The output is reported to be an ADC sum over
  one sample; also pedestals are for one sample only.
  This option is incompatible with sample-mode output.
short_description: Use peak sensing instead of sampling of the pulse.
