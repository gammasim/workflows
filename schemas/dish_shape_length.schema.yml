description: |-
  Dish curvature length, best equal to focal length. For a Davies-Cotton
  dish, this is the radius of the sphere on which the mirror tiles are
  positioned. For a parabolic dish, this is the focal length of the
  paraboloid on which the mirrors are placed. This parameter is only
  needed when variations to the standard shapes are tried out, e.g.
  intermediate shapes between parabolic and Davies-Cotton.
